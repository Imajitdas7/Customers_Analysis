Customer Analysis Project

Customer Analysis is a detailed analysis of a company's customers to gain insights into their specific needs, behaviors, and concerns. This analysis helps businesses better understand their customers and modify products or marketing strategies accordingly. By identifying customer segments that are most likely to purchase a particular product, businesses can optimize their marketing efforts and allocate resources more effectively.

Income: Customer's yearly household income 


Kidhome: Number of children in the customer's household 


Teenhome: Number of teenagers in the customer's household 


Dt_Customer: Date of customer's enrollment with the company 


Recency: Number of days since the customer's last purchase

MntSweetProducts: Amount spent on sweets in the last 2 years 


MntGoldProds: Amount spent on gold in the last 2 years 


NumDealsPurchases: Number of purchases made with a discount 


AcceptedCmp1: 1 if the customer accepted the offer in the 1st campaign, 0 otherwise 


AcceptedCmp2: 1 if the customer accepted the offer in the 2nd campaign, 0 otherwise 


AcceptedCmp3: 1 if the customer accepted the offer in the 3rd campaign, 0 otherwise 


AcceptedCmp4: 1 if the customer accepted the offer in the 4th campaign, 0 otherwise 


AcceptedCmp5: 1 if the customer accepted the offer in the 5th campaign, 0 otherwise 


Response: 1 if the customer accepted the offer in the last campaign, 0 otherwise


NumWebPurchases: Number of purchases made through the company's website 


NumCatalogPurchases: Number of purchases made using a catalog

Objective 

The objective of this project is to perform customer segmentation and analysis using various clustering techniques. By identifying distinct customer segments, we aim to understand their characteristics and preferences, enabling the company to tailor its products and marketing strategies for each segment.

 
Methodology
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct an in-depth analysis of the dataset, including data cleaning, handling missing values, exploring the distribution of variables, and identifying any correlations or patterns.


Clustering Analysis:  Apply different clustering techniques such as K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, or DBSCAN to segment the customers based on their attributes. Evaluate and compare the results of each clustering algorithm.


Cluster Analysis: Analyze the characteristics and behaviors of each customer segment, such as their income levels, purchase preferences, and response to marketing campaigns. This analysis will help in understanding the unique needs and behaviors of different customer segments.

Insights and Recommendations: Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the customer analysis. These recommendations may include targeted marketing strategies, product modifications, or personalized offers for specific customer segments.
